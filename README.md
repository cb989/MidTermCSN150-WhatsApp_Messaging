# MidTerm CSN150 - WhatsApp Messaging!
## Purpose:
Hello Prof! In my project, I setup the "CallMeBot API" in arduino using a random nerd tutorial with my ESP32 in order to send myself messages through WhatsApp using only the board.
## Name of project:
ESP32 WhatsApp Messaging
### What equipment did I need??
* [The ESP32 Cam](https://www.amazon.com/Aideepen-ESP32-CAM-ESP32-CAM-MB-CH-340G-NodeMCU/dp/B0CMTVFCYD/ref=sr_1_13?sr=8-13)
* Random old USB type C cable I had lying around my house!
### Links to the documentation I used to do my midterm:
* [ESP32: Send Messages to WhatsApp](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-send-messages-whatsapp/)
* [Free API to Send Whatsapp Messages](https://www.callmebot.com/blog/free-api-whatsapp-messages/)
### Here are the exact steps I used in order to get the code working as per the random nerd tutorial:
1. I went to sketch, include Library, manage libraries, and then I had to search for and install "URLEncode library" by Masayuki Sugahara as shown in the turorial.
2. I then used random nerd's, (or Rui Santo's) sample code
3. Change the necesary bits and pieces of the code, such as the SSID, the WiFi password,
